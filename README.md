# Description
This git repository contains all R-Scripts which were implemented in RStudio and all data associated with this thesis. All data analysis conducted in Aleksandar Maksimovic's bachelor thesis can be found in this repository.

In order to run the R-Scripts the file "Data.zip" needs to be unzipped first. Next, the proper file paths to the data files included in the Data folder need to be set so that R can find them (it depends on where the folder "Data" is located; the file structure within the folder "Data" should not be changed)


# Most relevant R-Scripts
