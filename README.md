# Description
This git repository contains all R-Scripts which were implemented in RStudio and all data and files associated with this thesis. All data analysis conducted in Aleksandar Maksimovic's bachelor thesis can be found in this repository.

In order to run the R-Scripts the file "Data.zip" needs to be unzipped first. Next, the proper file paths to the data files included in the Data folder need to be set so that R can find them (it depends on where the folder "Data" is located; the file structure within the folder "Data" should not be changed).


# Most relevant R-Scripts

 - **correlation_analysis_workplace_VARIABLE_time_comparison.R**

This file can be found at /Users/Aleks/Desktop/Studium/Bachelorarbeit/DataAnalytics/R projects/R_Bachelorarbeit/Zeitraumvergleich/

The dataset referred in chapter 4.4.1 was created through this script. The dataset can be found at 
/R projects/R_Bachelorarbeit/Zeitraumvergleich/dataframe_final_export.csv.

- **data_analysis_zeitraumvergleich.R**

This file can be found at /R projects/R_Bachelorarbeit/Zeitraumvergleich/.

The charts shown in chapter 4.4.1 were created through this script. The charts were stored in the file "plots.pdf".

 - **stenge_index_VARIABLE_time_comparison_correlation.R**

The dataset referred in chapter 4.6 was created through this script. The dataset can be found at 
/R projects/R_Bachelorarbeit/Zeitraumvergleich/corr_index_var_dataframe_final_export.csv.

- **index_data_analysis_zeitraumvergleich.R**

This file can be found at /R projects/R_Bachelorarbeit/Zeitraumvergleich/.

The charts shown in chapter 4.6 were created through this script. The charts were stored in the file "index_plots.pdf".

- **density_correlation_comparison_visualization.R**

The charts were stored in the file "plots_density.pdf".


- **massnahmenverlauf_gesamt_pro_jahre_unterkategorien.R**

The plots for the measures shown in Chapter 4.3 were created through this script.


# Data sources

- The Community Mobility Reports by Google, which were downloaded from their website, are stored in the folder /Data/Region_Mobility_Report_CSVs

- The data from the Corona Datenplattform regarding the Corona-Strength-Index and the measures imposed can be found in the folder /Data/Corona Datenplattform


# Miscellaneous

Multiple correlation analysis has been performed which did not make it into this thesis. Nevertheless, the assosiated scripts and graphs can be found at
/R projects/R_Bachelorarbeit/Zeitraumvergleich/.
